● SNV to existing BAM alignments (addsnv)

addsnv.py -v [varfile] -f [bamfile] -r [reference] -o [output] --picardfar [picardjar] --seed [seed number]

# Varfile = Target regions to try and add a SNV, as BED
# Bamfile = sam/bam file from which to obtain reads
# reference = reference genome, fasta indexed with bwa index and samtools faidx
# picardjar = path to picard.jar, required for most aligners
# seed = seed random number generation

=> Output consists of a BAM file containing the spike-in mutations and a directory of log files
describing which bases were changed in which reads (one log per mutation) and the local assemblies 
for each region where a mutation was made.
  
  output logfile can be transformed info VCF format using thr script makevcf.py 

makevcf.py [logfile]
